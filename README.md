##Automatic Character recognition using Digital Image Processing without any machine learning and deep learning.
The complete program is self explanatory. Perspective correction is done, the image is thresholded, boundaries detected and comparison with a template set is done to extract the character content of the image.
However we find that image processing approach to ACR is highly dependent on font of the text, style, etc.. and hence is of little use.
